# Hip Hop Word Guess
### Overview
This is a game where the player is challenged to guess 12 different hip hop artists by typing in letters while the game is active. When the player presses a key (A-Z), the game will check to see if that letter is in the current hip hop artist. If the guess was correct the letter is revealed and the player can guess again. If the guess was incorrect, the player will lose a guess and the letter will be added to a list of letters already guessed. This will continue unitl the player has correctly guessed every artist, or until they run out of guesses.
### Easy Mode
